  abstract={Comprehensively studying metabolism requires metabolite measurements. Such measurements, however, are often unavailable in large cohorts of tissue samples. To address this basic barrier, we propose a Bayesian framework (‘UnitedMet’) that leverages RNA–metabolite covariation to impute otherwise unmeasured metabolite levels from widely available transcriptomic data. UnitedMet is equally capable of imputing whole pool sizes and outcomes of isotope tracing experiments. We apply UnitedMet to investigate the metabolic impact of driver mutations in kidney cancer, identifying an association between BAP1 and a highly oxidative tumor phenotype. We similarly apply UnitedMet to determine that advanced kidney cancers upregulate oxidative phosphorylation relative to early-stage disease, that oxidative metabolism in kidney cancer is associated with inferior outcomes to anti-angiogenic therapy and that kidney cancer metastases demonstrate elevated oxidative phosphorylation. UnitedMet provides a scalable tool for assessing metabolic phenotypes when direct measurements are infeasible, facilitating unexplored avenues for metabolite-focused hypothesis generation.},

  abstract={The canonical model of tumor suppressor gene (TSG)-mediated oncogenesis posits that loss of both alleles is necessary for inactivation. Here, through allele-specific analysis of sequencing data from 48,179 cancer patients, we define the prevalence, selective pressure for, and functional consequences of biallelic inactivation across TSGs. TSGs largely assort into distinct classes associated with either pan-cancer (Class 1) or lineage-specific (Class 2) patterns of selection for biallelic loss, although some TSGs are predominantly monoallelically inactivated (Class 3/4). We demonstrate that selection for biallelic inactivation can be utilized to identify driver genes in non-canonical contexts, including among variants of unknown significance (VUSs) of several TSGs such as KEAP1. Genomic, functional, and clinical data collectively indicate that KEAP1 VUSs phenocopy established KEAP1 oncogenic alleles and that zygosity, rather than variant classification, is predictive of therapeutic response. TSG zygosity is therefore a fundamental determinant of disease etiology and therapeutic sensitivity.},

Somatic alterations to mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) nearly always arise heteroplasmically, producing heterogeneous ensembles of mtDNA within single cells. Here, we review new insights derived from exponential increases in genomic sequencing data that have uncovered the nature of, selective pressure for, and functional consequences of cancer-associated mtDNA alterations. As many discoveries have been limited by their ability to determine cell-to-cell variation in mtDNA genotype, we describe a new generation of single-cell sequencing approaches that resolve otherwise indeterminate models of mtDNA heteroplasmy. In tandem with novel approaches for mtDNA editing and modeling of mutations, these advances foreshadow the quantitative dissection of dosage-dependent mtDNA phenotypes that underlie both tumor evolution and heterogeneous response to therapies.},

Cells typically contained thousands of mtDNA copies, but variation in mtDNA copy number was extensive and strongly associated with cell size. Pervasive whole-genome doubling events in nuDNA associated with stoichiometrically balanced adaptations in mtDNA copy number, implying that mtDNA-to-nuDNA ratio, rather than mtDNA copy number itself, mediated downstream phenotypes. Finally, multimodal analysis of DLP+ and single-cell RNA sequencing identified both somatic loss-of-function and germline noncoding variants in mtDNA linked to heteroplasmy-dependent changes in mtDNA copy number and mitochondrial transcription, revealing phenotypic adaptations to disrupted nuclear/mitochondrial balance.},

  abstract={The mitochondrial genome (mtDNA) encodes essential machinery for oxidative phosphorylation and metabolic homeostasis. Tumor mtDNA is among the most somatically mutated regions of the cancer genome, but whether these mutations impact tumor biology is debated. We engineered truncating mutations of the mtDNA-encoded complex I gene, Mt-Nd5, into several murine models of melanoma. These mutations promoted a Warburg-like metabolic shift that reshaped tumor microenvironments in both mice and humans, consistently eliciting an anti-tumor immune response characterized by loss of resident neutrophils. Tumors bearing mtDNA mutations were sensitized to checkpoint blockade in a neutrophil-dependent manner, with induction of redox imbalance being sufficient to induce this effect in mtDNA wild-type tumors. Patient lesions bearing >50% mtDNA mutation heteroplasmy demonstrated a response rate to checkpoint blockade that was improved by ~2.5-fold over mtDNA wild-type cancer. These data nominate mtDNA mutations as functional regulators of cancer metabolism and tumor biology, with potential for therapeutic exploitation and treatment stratification.},

To study IMH, we profiled tumor/normal regions from clear cell renal cell carcinoma (ccRCC) patients. A common pattern of IMH transcended all patients, characterized by correlated fluctuations in the abundance of metabolites and processes associated with ferroptosis. Analysis of intratumoral metabolite-RNA covariation revealed that the immune composition of the microenvironment, especially the abundance of myeloid cells, drove intratumoral metabolite variation. Motivated by the strength of RNA-metabolite covariation and the clinical significance of RNA biomarkers in ccRCC, we inferred metabolomic profiles from the RNA sequencing data of ccRCC patients enrolled in 7 clinical trials, and we ultimately identifyied metabolite biomarkers associated with response to anti-angiogenic agents. Local metabolic phenotypes, therefore, emerge in tandem with the immune microenvironment, influence ongoing tumor evolution, and are associated with therapeutic sensitivity.},

  abstract={Tumour metabolism is controlled by coordinated changes in metabolite abundance and gene expression, but simultaneous quantification of metabolites and transcripts in primary tissue is rare. To overcome this limitation and to study gene–metabolite covariation in cancer, we assemble the Cancer Atlas of Metabolic Profiles of metabolomic and transcriptomic data from 988 tumour and control specimens spanning 11 cancer types in published and newly generated datasets. Meta-analysis of the Cancer Atlas of Metabolic Profiles reveals two classes of gene–metabolite covariation that transcend cancer types. The first corresponds to gene–metabolite pairs engaged in direct enzyme–substrate interactions, identifying putative genes controlling metabolite pool sizes. A second class of gene–metabolite covariation represents a small number of hub metabolites, including quinolinate and nicotinamide adenine dinucleotide, which correlate to many genes specifically expressed in immune cell populations. These results provide evidence that gene–metabolite covariation in cellularly heterogeneous tissue arises, in part, from both mechanistic interactions between genes and metabolites, and from remodelling of the bulk metabolome in specific immune microenvironments.},

MIRTH successfully recovers masked metabolite abundances both within single datasets and across multiple, independently-profiled datasets. MIRTH demonstrates that latent information about otherwise unmeasured metabolites is embedded within existing metabolomics data, and can be used to generate novel hypotheses and simplify existing metabolomic workflows.}

  abstract={Mitochondrial DNA (mtDNA) encodes protein subunits and translational machinery required for oxidative phosphorylation (OXPHOS). Using repurposed whole-exome sequencing data, in the present study we demonstrate that pathogenic mtDNA mutations arise in tumours at a rate comparable to those in the most common cancer driver genes. We identify OXPHOS complexes as critical determinants shaping somatic mtDNA mutation patterns across tumour lineages. Loss-of-function mutations accumulate at an elevated rate specifically in complex I and often arise at specific homopolymeric hotspots. In contrast, complex V is depleted of all non-synonymous mutations, suggesting that impairment of ATP synthesis and mitochondrial membrane potential dissipation are under negative selection. Common truncating mutations and rarer missense alleles are both associated with a pan-lineage transcriptional programme, even in cancer types where mtDNA mutations are comparatively rare. Pathogenic mutations of mtDNA are associated with substantial increases in overall survival of colorectal cancer patients, demonstrating a clear functional relationship between genotype and phenotype. The mitochondrial genome is therefore frequently and functionally disrupted across many cancers, with major implications for patient stratification, prognosis and therapeutic development.},

The discovery and functional characterization of individual driver mutations are central aims of cancer research, and have elucidated myriad phenotypes and therapeutic vulnerabilities. However, the serial genetic evolution of mutant cancer genes, and the allelic context in which they arise is poorly understood in both common and rare cancer genes and tumour types. Here we find that nearly one in four human tumours contains a composite mutation of a cancer-associated gene, defined as two or more nonsynonymous somatic mutations in the same gene and tumour. Composite mutations are enriched in specific genes, have an elevated rate of use of less-common hotspot mutations acquired in a chronology driven in part by oncogenic fitness, and arise in an allelic configuration that reflects context-specific selective pressures. cis-acting composite mutations are hypermorphic in some genes in which dosage effects predominate (such as TERT), whereas they lead to selection of function in other genes (such as TP53). Collectively, composite mutations are driver alterations that arise from context- and allele-specific selective pressures that are dependent in part on gene and mutation function, and which lead to complex—often neomorphic—functions of biological and therapeutic importance.},
