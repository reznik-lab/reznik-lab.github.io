Welcome to the Reznik Lab in the [Computational Oncology Service](https://www.mskcc.org/departments/epidemiology-biostatistics/computational-oncology) at the [Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center](https://www.mskcc.org/). 

We are a team of computational biologists using statistical and machine learning methods to analyze large-scale datasets to answer questions around cancer metabolism, immunometabolism, and the interactions between host physiology and tumour biology.

We are interested in interested in creative, integrative models of living systems that mesh heterogeneous types of high-throughput and low-throughput data.
